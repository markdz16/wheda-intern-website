			<p> The Information Technology (IT) Department plays a vital behind-the-scenes role in how housing happens at the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA). As Systems Analyst Interns, we — Mark Dorado-Zapata and Chueyee Lo — have supported WHEDA’s mission by providing level one help desk assistance, maintaining system documentation, and resolving technical issues that help staff work efficiently. </p>
			<p> The tickets we’ve handled have included password resets, access requests, address changes, and loan number updates. As of July 30, 2025, we have successfully closed 41 tickets, saving senior systems analysts over 20 hours by resolving lower-level issues and improving documentation. </p>
			<p> Mark has primarily supported multi-family systems, while Chueyee has focused on single-family systems — both of which are central to WHEDA’s housing efforts.  </p>
			<p> Our work this summer has shown us just how much housing depends on technology. When WHEDA staff have quick and reliable system support, they can focus more time and energy on the core work of helping Wisconsinites access affordable housing. By resolving routine technical problems and improving documentation, we’ve helped ensure that the tools WHEDA employees rely on remain functional and efficient. </p>
			<p> In short, housing happens at WHEDA when the systems work — and we’re proud to have played a part in making that happen. </p>
